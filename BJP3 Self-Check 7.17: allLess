//Write a method called allLess that accepts two arrays of integers and returns true if each element in the first array is less than the element at 
//the same index in the second array. Your method should return false if the arrays are not the same length. For example, if the two arrays passed are 
//{45, 20, 300} and {50, 41, 600}, your method should return true. If the arrays are not the same length, you should always return false. 

public static boolean allLess(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
    // Check if the two arrays have the same length
    if (arr1.length != arr2.length) {
        // If the arrays have different lengths, return false
        return false;
    }
    // Iterate over each element in the arrays
    for (int i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        // Check if the element at index i in arr1 is less than the element at index i in arr2
        if (arr1[i] >= arr2[i]) {
            // If the element at index i in arr1 is not less than the element at index i in arr2, return false
            return false;
        }
    }
    // If the loop completes and all elements in arr1 are less than the corresponding elements in arr2, return true
    return true;
